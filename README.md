### Foreword
The 3 volumes of the continuous learning trilogy provide a practical synthesis on the best practices I gained as Trainer and Product Owner (P.O) of web application in the Media industry.

- Book #1: The good and small "Zambian" guide for WordPress. How to run a News Website with WordPress?

- Book #2:  Defining a testing automation strategy for a P.O. with CODECEPTION_ & WordPress

- Book #3: Redefining a testing automation strategy for a P.O. with CodeceptJS & WordPress

1.  The Book #1 gathers all the materials that I brought with me to deliver a training session in Zambia to a team of journalists from the domestic network ZNBC on how to manage and run a news website. I made as intuitive and operational as possible. It has been transposed mostly to WordPress so anyone can leverage on it. It entails good practices under constraints such as budget, technical environment and team resources.

2.  The Book #2 & Book #3 present my understanding and practical experience of web application testing that I gained as Product Owner (P.O) in the Media industry. In these two books, I focus on user acceptance testing that is one of the biggest challenges for a PO of a large web application (back office, website).  How to minimize the risks of the acceptance phase?  How to master its duration? How to avoid regressions and side effects. Book #2 & Book #3 aim at answering those questions with the help of CP (Codeception) and CPJS (CodeceptJS).

### Acknowledgments

For book #2 & book #3, after a quick benchmark of the market solutions and the constraints that were mine, I totally relied on Codeception and CodeceptJS. I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank the Codeception (CP) and CodeceptJS (CPJS) team's excellent work and remarkable documentation that accompanies it. Without this documentation, I believe that I would not have taken such a step.

### Book Introduction

**Writing another book on testing is insane!**

I should be locked up :) Such a fury in design a testing strategy can only be suspicious! But not for me, this is a logical consequence of a continuous learning process. With this ultimate book, that is not a product of my boredom but rather than a final step in my understanding of testing in a bottom-up approach.

This bottom-up approach allowed me to make more exploration and experimentation with testing with the help of CPJS.

In this book, I tried to be as straightforward as possible. Good reading.

### Code
**I try not to forget anything. The best thing to do is to make a fresh installation of CodeceptJS (CPJS), finalize the configuration and then cut and paste the testing files one after the other with a WP running on custom URL in MAMP.**
